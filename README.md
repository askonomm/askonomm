### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a polyglot software engineer with a decade of experience in variety of industries, programming languages and tech stacks. Currently working as a freelance software consultant offering services for digital agencies and start-ups. Feel free to get in touch if you want to collaborate via [asko@asko.dev](mailto:asko@asko.dev). 

#### Open Source Work

I'm only actively working on [Shape CMS](https://github.com/askonomm/shape) right now (and libs it depends on like [shape-core](https://github.com/askonomm/shape-core), [router](https://github.com/askonomm/router) and [hird](https://github.com/askonomm/hird)). Everything else you see on my profile is effectively in maintenance only.
