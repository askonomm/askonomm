### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a polyglot software engineer with a decade of experience in variety of industries, programming languages and tech stacks. Currently working as a freelance software consultant offering services for digital agencies and start-ups. Feel free to get in touch if you want to collaborate via [asko@asko.dev](mailto:asko@asko.dev). 

#### Open Source Work

I'm only actively working on [Preach](https://github.com/askonomm/preach) right now. Everything else you see on my profile is effectively in maintenance only in that whenever a bug is reported I will do my best to fix it, but I am not working on any new features.
